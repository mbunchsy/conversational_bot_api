# ü§ñ Bot Conversational API ‚Äî Technical Assignment

## üìå Overview

This project is a conversational API system developed using Django and PostgreSQL, designed as a technical assignment for a AI engineer role. It supports:
‚Ä¢ Multi-turn conversations
‚Ä¢ System prompts
‚Ä¢ Audio and text input
‚Ä¢ Multilingual support
‚Ä¢ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using pgvector over PostgreSQL

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### üõ† Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Make (for running commands)
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### Installation

1. Install Poetry if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
make shell
```

4. Run tests:

```bash
make test-all
```

## üß™ Environment

```bash
cp ./environments/.env.local.example ./environments/.env.local
```

## üöÄ Run the project

```bash
make docker-init
```
## Load documents for vector database
```bash
make load-documents
```


This will:
‚Ä¢ Build containers
‚Ä¢ Start services
‚Ä¢ Run Django migrations
‚Ä¢ Expose API at http://localhost:8000/

## System Architecture Overview

The application follows a Clean Architecture pattern with these main layers:

### Domain Layer

- **Entities**: Core business objects ([`ConversationEntity`](chatapp/domain/entities/conversation.py), [`MessageEntity`](chatapp/domain/entities/message.py), [`UserEntity`](chatapp/domain/entities/user.py))
- **Repositories**: Abstract interfaces for data persistence
- **Exceptions**: Custom domain exceptions for better error handling

### Application Layer

- **Use Cases**: Business logic implementation
  - [`CreateConversationUseCase`](chatapp/application/create_conversation_use_case.py): Handles conversation creation
  - [`ProcessMessageUseCase`](chatapp/application/process_message_use_case.py): Manages message processing
  - [`ProcessMessageAudioUseCase`](chatapp/application/process_message_audio_use_case.py): Manages audio message processing
  - [`CreateConversationSummaryUseCase`](chatapp/application/create_conversation_summary_use_case.py): Generates summaries and extracts data

### Infrastructure Layer

- **Repositories**: Concrete implementations of repository interfaces
- **Services**: External service integrations (e.g., LLM service)
- **Database**: Data persistence implementations

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Clean Architecture**

   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Domain-driven design principles
   - Independence from external frameworks
   - Easily testable components

2. **Use Case Pattern**

   - Each business operation is encapsulated in a use case
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Easy to extend and modify

3. **Domain Model**

   - Rich domain model with business logic
   - Encapsulated validation
   - Immutable where possible
   - Clear state transitions

4. **Error Handling**

   - Custom domain exceptions
   - Proper error propagation
   - Detailed error messages and codes
   - Validation at domain level

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive unit tests
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test different scenarios and edge cases
   - Clear test organization

## Potential Improvements

  - Authentication & Authorization: Secures your API and lets you control who can access and do what ‚Äî essential for scaling and multi-user environments.
  - Real-time updates: Delivers a modern, responsive UX by pushing updates instantly ‚Äî ideal for live messaging and better user engagement.
  - Add API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger): Makes your API easy to understand and integrate, reducing confusion and speeding up collaboration.
  - Prompting: Well-structured prompts improve response quality, control tone, and adapt behavior ‚Äî critical when using LLMs.
  - Add message pagination: Boosts performance and scalability by handling long conversations more efficiently.
  - Add monitoring and logging: Provides visibility into system health, helping you catch issues early and optimize behavior based on real usage.
  - Add integration tests: Ensure the full system works as expected ‚Äî not just in pieces, but end-to-end, which builds confidence and stability.
